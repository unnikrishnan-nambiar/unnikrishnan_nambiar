## Editing content

- `data/site.ts` — contact details (email, phone, WhatsApp), social links, nav.
- `data/useCases.ts` — the 12 use cases (from the sales deck).
- `data/ferry.ts` — Ferry features, steps, analytics, **pricing plans** and FAQ.
- `public/brand/` — wordmarks from the official logo pack. `app/icon.png` /
  `app/apple-icon.png` are the "ryx" app icons from the same pack.

## Contact form

The site is a static export, so there's no backend. The early-access form
on `/contact` composes the enquiry and opens the visitor's email app (to
hello@ryxai.in) or WhatsApp with it prefilled. Pricing cards link to
`/contact?interest=ferry#early-access` to preselect the plan.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds and deploys a static export on
every push to `main`. One-time setup: in the repo's Settings → Pages, set
**Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router), static export
- Tailwind CSS
- No backend or database
